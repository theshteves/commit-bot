# Deploy locally by adding the following line to your crontab:
# 0 22 * * * /bin/bash /<full-path-to-your-folder>/code/commit-bot/bot.sh
#
# Edit your crontab in vim w/ the simple command:
# crontab -e
#
# Deploying just on your computer is better than a server if you want
# your commits to more realistically mirror your computer usage.

# ...c'mon, nobody commits EVERY day ;)
